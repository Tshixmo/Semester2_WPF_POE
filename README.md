Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)

Welcome to the Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS), a WPF-based application designed to streamline the submission and approval of monthly claims for Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers. 
This application simplifies the administrative process, enabling lecturers to submit their claims, and program coordinators and academic managers to review and approve them efficiently.

Features Include 
User Authentication: Login and role-based access (Lecturer, Program Coordinator, Academic Manager)
Claim Submission: Lecturers can submit claims with details like hours worked and hourly rate
Document Upload: Upload supporting documents for claims
Claim Tracking: View the status of submitted claims
Claim Approval: Coordinators and managers can approve or reject claims
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive WPF-based GUI



Once the application is running, you can:
Log in as a Lecturer, Program Coordinator, or Academic Manager.
Submit a New Claim: Enter the hours worked and the hourly rate, and submit your claim along with supporting documents.
View Previous Claims: Track the status of your previous claims.
Approve Claims: If logged in as a Program Coordinator or Academic Manager, you can review and approve/reject claims.


Future Enhancements
Functional Back-end: Currently, the application is in the prototyping phase. The next step is to implement the back-end to connect to a database for storing user data and claims.
Enhanced Security: Implement more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
